            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CAptain <hi>Charles Walſingham</hi> having taken his Tryal at the <hi>Seſſions-Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> upon Three Indictments. The Firſt, for killing one Mr. <hi>Carr</hi> on the 28th of <hi>December</hi> laſt, by giving him ſeveral mortal Bruiſes. The Second, for killing <hi>John Stoner,</hi> by giving him a mortal Wound with a Rapier in the Belly on the 29th of <hi>March</hi> laſt. And the Third, for killing <hi>John Harbin</hi> on the 28th of <hi>May,</hi> 1688. by giving him a mortal Wound with a Rapier under the Armpit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon this being found Guilty of Wilful Murther, and Sentence of Death paſſing upon him, he was conveyed back to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where, for a time, he continued not much ſenſible of the deplorable Condition he was in; but divers Eminent Miniſters uſing ſpiritual Applications to ſoften the Hardneſs of his Heart, he grew more and more affected, cloſing with their Advice and Counſel, and in a ſhort time a wonderful Change viſibly appeared.

To which with ſome Sighs, he replied in general terms, <hi>That he had been a great Sinner, and had been much carried away by Evil Company, deſiring the Spectators to look upon him as a deplorable Spectable of God's

And that he had Bleſſed God that he had given him a time to Repent, when he had hurried others out of the World, without any ſuch ſpace or opportunity; deſiring the Auditors to make Good of the precious oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity put into their hands, leſt ſome of them might be in like manner carried out of the World, without time to Repent. Praying therein for the King and Queen's Majeſties by Name; as alſo for the Welfare, Settlement, and Tranquility of the Nation, deſiring God to Bleſs the CHURCH of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> of whom he confeſſed himſelf a Member, and concluded the Paper with a Pious and hearty Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The Paper being read, he was Prayed with, and deſired to forgive all People that had any ways injured him, and ask Forgiveneſs of thoſe he had injured, which he did with an audible Voice, and then proceeded to make a Confeſſion of his Faith in the Apoſtles Creed. After this ſeveral Paſſages were again repeated out of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and in conſideration he ſtood upon the brink of the Grave, and might truly be termed a Dying Man, the <hi>Prayer uſed at the Viſitation of the Sick</hi> was read, with other Conſolation; and being ſubject to ſome little Fainting under this great Tryal, he was ſupported a little by a Perſon that was in the Cart to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, yet the Miniſter at his Inſtance, declared that it was not through the fear of Death, for his Life having been all along Martial, the fear of Death, as it was meerly ſo, was beneath him, but the ſenſe of his Sins had broken him under the ſenſe of God's Wrath and Diſpleaſure, which he might juſtly fear, did not the greatneſs of his Mercy interpoſe. However, there was hopes of Pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to Sinners, upon a true and ſincere Repentance, minding him of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and others; and after divers other Prayers for confirming him in this his great Extremity, he kiſſed and embraced the Miniſters, and prepared himſelf for Death, not deſiring a Pſalm, tho' it was offered, leſt it might diſcompoſe him, as being now ſolemnly fixed upon Thoughts of Eternity, and appearing before the Dreadful Tribunal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being bid by one of the Miniſters to ſay at his going off, <hi>Lord into thy hands I recommend my Spirit, Lord receive my Soul;</hi> he continued ſo to do after the Cap was drawn over his Eyes, till the Cart drew away.</p>
